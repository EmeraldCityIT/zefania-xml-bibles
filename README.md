# Zefania XML bibles
This is a clone of all XML files from Zefania XML 

## Motivation of this clone
* The origin project at SourceForge hasn't provided appropriate interfaces for automated processing using SVN, GIT, GitHub or similar. 
* All XML bibles have been provided as ZIP instead of plain XML - for further analysis and direct usage, plain XML is required
