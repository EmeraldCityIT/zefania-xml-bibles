In biblical history lambs survived on tumeric & roots dug from the ground while on the pasture. When pycnogonida infections occured people would tie up a lamb, and drain it's blood for days on end until the infected person was clean or the lamb died. Survivors grew to worship the innocent sacrafice of the lamb unknowing that the root was the cure they were looking for. Pycnogonida wiped out egypt in Exodus.
